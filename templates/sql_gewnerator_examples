Here is a list of open-source language models that can be used for generating SQL queries and validating their output:
1. BART (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): A popular language model developed by Facebook AI that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks like SQL query generation.
2. T5 (Text-to-Text Transformer): A text-to-text transformer model that can be used for a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including SQL query generation.
3. ELECTRA (Efficient Lifelong End-to-End Text Recognition with Attention): A text-to-text transformer model that can be used for generating SQL queries and validating their output.
4. Megatron-LM (Mega Transformer Language Model): A large language model that can be used for generating SQL queries and validating their output.
5. DistilBERT (Distilled BERT): A smaller and more efficient version of BERT that can be used for generating SQL queries and validating their output.
As for GitHub repositories that use LLMS to generate natural language to SQL queries, here are a few examples:
1. sqllvm/sql-query-generator: This repository uses T5 to generate SQL queries from natural language input. It also includes a database interface to validate the queries and generate the output.
2. ni-iu/sql-query-gen: This repository uses BART to generate SQL queries from natural language input. It also includes a database interface to validate the queries and generate the output.
3. alibaba/nl-sql: This repository uses a combination of BERT and T5 to generate SQL queries from natural language input. It also includes a database interface to validate the queries and generate the output.
4. moxoor/sql-query-generator-bert: This repository uses DistilBERT to generate SQL queries from natural language input. It also includes a database interface to validate the queries and generate the output.
5. zhangjunjie/sql-query-generator-t5: This repository uses T5 to generate SQL queries from natural language input. It also includes a database interface to validate the queries and generate the output.
Keep in mind that these are just a few examples, and there are many other repositories and models available that can be used for generating SQL queries from natural language input.
